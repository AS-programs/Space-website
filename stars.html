<h1>What is a star??<h1>
<p>A star is a huge ball of gas and plasma which produces its own light.Its estimated that there are about 10^24 stars in the observale universe.The<br>
Stars are formed through nebulas.Nebulas are very large(some are even few hundred light years across) bodies of gases.Due to gravity the gases in a<br>
nebula begin to clump together.This keeps going on until the core of the star gets hot and dense enough to start nuclear fusion.Nuclear fusion in the<br>
core of stars starts at about 15 million kelvin.In the core of stars hydrogen atoms are ionized into protons(the electron escapes).These protons bump <br>
into each other and sometimes combine to form a deuterium hydrogen isotope.Another proton combines with this deuterium to form a helium3 atom.Two <br>
helium3 atoms combine to form a 4helium atom and 2 protons.In this reaction the mass of the products is slighly less than the reactants.So where did this<br>
mass go?According to Albert Einstein's formula E=mc^2 mass can be converted into a lot of energy.So this lost mass has been converted into energy(heat<br>
and light).This is what causes the stars to glow.</p>

<h2>Classification of stars-<h2>
<p>In astronomy classification of stars is done based on observations of their light which can give us information about their temperature and composition.<br>
Previously stars were classified on the basis of their colors.However today they are classified on the basis of their surface temperaturs.The Morganâ€“Keenan <br>
system uses the letters O,B,A,F,G,K and M from the hottest(O type) to the coolest(M type).Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 <br>
being hottest and 9 being coolest (e.g., A8, A9, F0, and F1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler).Also in MK system a luminosity class is added based on <br>
the width of certain absorbtion line in the spectrum.Luminosity classes 0 and I apply to hyper- or supergiants; classes II, III and IV apply to bright, regular<br>
giants, and subgiants, respectively; class V is for main-sequence stars; and class VI and VII apply to subdwarfs and dwarf stars.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h4>But how do we know the temperature of a star??</h4>
<p>It is not possible to physically measure the temperature of a star.So we have to resort to observing its light spectrum.Wien's law states that the <br>
wavelengths of light emitted by a blackbody will depend on the temperature of the object.Astronomers measure the wavelengths coming from a star find <br>
its peak and based on the data,they determine its type.</p>

<h4>Why are there no green or purple stars??</h4>
<p>The answer to this question lies in the Planckian locus graph given above.In this graph the outer curved edge as all the monochromatic colors.<br>
(single wavelength).A star's spectrum is a combination of these colors.During a certain surface temperature of the star its spectrum will peak<br>
in green.However when this happens there will also be a lot of other wavelegths that will be emited by the star.While green will be the highest<br>
there will be a roughly equal amount comming from the blue and red side.Same issue comes with purple.In the locus graph above the black line<br>
displaying different temperatures has all the colors a star could be in.As we see this line never touches purple or green.To reach purple it<br>
needs atleast infinite temperature.The hottest star is WR102 with a surface temperature of 210,000 kelvin(or 210,000 degree celsisus).>br><br>
Here how the spectrum of a "green" star looks like-<br>

<p>Also hotter stars usually have more mass and volume.This mass increases the pressure and hence the heat.As the stars get hotter they<br>
emit more blue light.Hot stars also have a shorter lifespan as they burn(nuclear fusion not combustion) through their fuel(hydrogen) more<br>
quickly.A middle sized star takes a few billion years to burn throught its fuel whereas a blue supergiant star will take only a few <br>
hundred million years.<br></p>

<p>All of this data regarding temperature and luminousity can be represented on a Hertzsprung Russell Diagram(H-R diagram).In this diagram<br>
the horizontal axis shows temperature decreasing to the right and vertical axis shows luminosity increasing upwards.The curve in the middle<br>
shows main sequence stars which account for 90% of the stars in the universe.The sun is a G-type main sequence star.<br>
