<h3>Neutron rocket-</h3>
<p>The neutron rocket is a partially reusable medium lift launch vehicle currently<br>
being developed by rocket lab.It will be made out of carbon fibre.It consists of a <br>
reusable first stage with 4 integrated fairings,and an expendable upper stage with <br>
ayload on top of it stored in the fairings.In space the fairing will open up and<br>
release the second stage and the payload and then the fairing will close again and<br>
the first stage will perform a retrograde burn while reentry.Then it will use its <br>
fins to manuever it towards the launch site.Then it will a landing burn to land at<br>
the launch site.This is possible as the first stage will have very little horizontal<br>
velocity at stage separation compared to falcon 9 first stage which has a lot of<br>
horizontal velocity at stage separation and RTLS(Return To Launch Site) is usually<br>
not feasible, so it lands on droneships usually.</p>

<h3>Starship</h3>
<img src = "starship1.jpg">
<p>Starship is a fully reusable super heavy lift launch vehicle currently in development.It is built by spacex and is expected<br>
to have its first orbital flight this year(2022).The location for consturction of these prototypes is boca chica,texas,usa.<br>
The rocket consists of the second stage(confusingly also called as starship) and the first stage(called as super heavy).<br>
It is powered by the raptor engine which runs on full flow staged combustion cycle.Here 2 gas generators are used and both<br>
fuel rich and oxygen rich fluid is mixed and ignited in combustion chamber.The super heavy will have 33 sea level raptor<br>
engines and the starship will have 3 sea level and 3 or 6 vacuum raptor engines.<br>
Upon ignition the rocket will liftoff.Once in space the starship will separate.Then it will use its 4 grid fins to manuever<Br>
back to launch site.Here it will light its engines and land on 2 big mechanical arms on a tower.This is done to save landing<br>
legs mass.Meanwhile the starship will light its engines to reach orbit.Once its mission is done it will perform a small burn<br>
to lower its perigee into the atmosphere.Then it will do a reentry.The front side of the starship is covered with heat shield<br>
tiles to prevent it from heating too much and breaking apart.It will use its flaps to slow itself down using air resistance.<br>
It will belly flop till its near the launch pad again.Then it will tilt its engines and perform a burn to tilt the starship <br>
into an upright position and land it into the arms of the tower.The stages will then be checked,stacked again,and be ready to<br>
be launched again.There is also a HLS(Human Landing System) variant of starship which nasa has payed spacex to develop for <br>
landing astronaut back to the moon under the artemis mission.</p>
