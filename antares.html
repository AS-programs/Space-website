<p>Originally the antares rocket wasnt able to get the COTS contract.It was only after Rocketplane Kistler failed to acquire funding they got selected.<br>
The antares was originally called the Taurus 2.It is used to launch the cygnus cargo spacecraft to the iss.</p>
<h3>Antares 100 series</h3>
<p>The AJ26 which is a modified form of NK-33 which is a closed cycle ox-rich kerolox engine was used to power the first stage.43 of which were purchased<br>
by Aerojet in the 1990s. Twenty of these were refurbished into AJ26 engines for Antares.Modifications included equipping the engines for gimballing,<br>
adding US electronics, and qualifying the engines to fire for twice as long as designed and to operate at 108% of their original thrust.Following the<br>
catastrophic failure of an AJ26 during testing at Stennis Space Center in May 2014 and the Orb-3 launch failure in October 2014,the 100 series was retired.
</p>

<h3>Antares 200 series</h3>
<p>
Because of concerns over corrosion, aging, and the limited supply of AJ26 engines,the Russian RD-181(modified form of the soviet RD-191) was used.The<br>
Antares 200 and 200+ first stages are powered by two RD-181 engines, which provide 440 kilonewtons more thrust than the dual AJ26 engines used<br>
 on the Antares 100. 200 series adapted the originally ordered 100 Series stages,but it required under-throttling the RD181 which reduced performance.<bt>
The antares 230+ had structural changes made to the intertank bay (between the LO2 and RP-1 tanks) and the forward bay (forward of the LO2).
</p>
<br>
<p>
The second stage is an Orbital ATK Castor 30-series solid-fuel rocket.The first two flights of Antares used a Castor 30A, which was replaced by the<br>
enhanced Castor 30B which had thrust vector control capability.Antares offers three optional third stages: the Bi-Propellant Third Stage (BTS), a Star<br>
48-based third stage and an Orion 38 motor.

<h2>Cygnus spacecraft-</h2>
<p>Cygnus is a american cargo spacecraft used to supply the ISS.It consists of 2 parts - Pressurized Cargo Module(PCM) and<br>
Service Module(SM).The PCMs have a volume of 18 m^3Â·The srvice module has a thruster powered by hypergolic propellants <br>
hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.The spacecraft can produce 4kW of power via the solar arrays.<br>
The fourth and all subsequent Cygnus spacecraft are planned to be of the "Enhanced" variant, as the standard variant has<br>
been retired.These will have a larger PCM with interior volume of 27m^3.With the enhanced cygnus,the Castor 30XL will be <br>
used as the upper stage,and because of this more powerful upper stage,and lighter solar arrays,enhanced cygnus will be able<br>
to deliver 700kg more to the ISS.<br></p>

<p>
During mission the cygnus spacecraft manuevers to the station where it is attached to the Canadarm2 robotic arm.Then the canadarm<br>
attaches the cygnus to the common berthing mechanism of the Harmony module.This is also done in the japanese h-2,spacex dragon 1.<br>

<h2>Missions-</h2>
<p>Antares A-ONE -<br>
Antares A-ONE was the maiden flight of the antares rocket.It carried a cygnus mass simulator(fake cygnus) to orbit along with four cubesats.<br>
<br>
CRS Orb-3-<br>
On October 28, 2014, an Antares carrying a Cygnus cargo spacecraft on the Orb-3 resupply mission failed catastrophically six seconds after <br>
liftoff.The thrust section exploded,cauing the rocket to fall back to the pad and explode.It was caused by a failure failure of the first <br>
stage LOX turbopump.This delayed future antares missions,and cygnus spacecrafts were launched on an atlas 5 instead(OA-4,Oa-6).
