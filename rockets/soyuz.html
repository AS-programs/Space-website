<h1>Soyuz</h1>
<p>
The soyuz is a very successful russian/soviet series of launch vehicles.The rockets were developed by OKB-1 and manufactured by Progress Rocket<br>
Space Centre in Samara,Russia.Soyuz is the most frequaently used launch vehicle with over 1900 flights since its debut in 1966.

<h3>Soyuz(rocket) -</h3>
<p>The soyuz is a soviet expendable launch vehicle designed to launch crew aboard the soyuz spacecraft.It launched the spacecraft 27 times(8 times uncrewed)<br>
and 19 crewed).Its first four test launches were all failures, but eventually it worked.The aborted Soyuz 18-1 launch in 1975 was the final crewed flight of<br>
this rocket as it was going to be replaced by the Soyuz-U.</p>
<h3>Soyuz-L</h3>
<p>The soyuz was created to test the LK lunar lander in LEO.The Soyuz-L was a derivative of the original Soyuz rocket featuring<br>
 the reinforced first stage and boosters supporting the Molniya-M's third stage, so that it could carry a more massive payload.<br>
 A larger payload fairing was also fitted, to accommodate the LK spacecraft.</p>
<h3>Soyuz-U -</h3>
<p>The soyuz-U was an improved version of the original soyuz rocket.It was one of the most reliable launch vehicles with<br>
a world record 786 missions and a success rate of 97.3%.Two versions of Soyuz-U with different upper stages were the <br>
Soyuz-U/Ikar and the Soyuz-U/Fregat.The performance of the Ikar upper stage is lower than that of the Fregat upper stage,<br>
but it is more precise in maneuvering and it can operate autonomously longer.</p>
<h3>Soyuz-M</h3>
<p>The aoyuz-M is another version of soyuz built to launch military soyuz spacecraft.But after the cancellation of that<br>
programme,development of the rocket was abandoned and the rockets that were completed were used to launch reconnaissance<br>
satellites.</p>
<h3>Soyuz-U2 -</h3>
<p>The Soyuz-U2 was a Soviet, later Russian, carrier rocket.It had increased performance compared to the soyuz U2 due to <br>
the use of syntin propellant,as opposed to RP-1 parrafin used on soyuz U2.The increased payload of the Soyuz-U2 allowed<br>
heavier spacecraft to be launched, while lighter spacecraft could be placed in higher orbits.In 1996, it was announced<br>
that the Soyuz-U2 had been retired, as the performance advantage gained through the use of syntin did not justify the<br>
additional cost of its production.It was used to launch crewed soyuz missions,progress spacecraft crgo missions and <br>
reconnaissance satellites.</p>
<h3>Soyuz-FG</h3>
<p>The Soyuz-FG launch vehicle was an improved version of the Soyuz-U.Soyuz-FG made its maiden flight on 20 May 2001,<br>
carrying a Progress cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS).Its first failure occured due to a faulty<br>
sensor on the MS-10 mission.It was retired after the 25 September 2019 launch of Soyuz MS-15 to the ISS; the analog control<br>
system significantly limited its capabilities and prompted its replacement by Soyuz-2.</p>
<h3>Soyuz-2</h3>
<p>Soyuz-2 is a modernized version of the Soviet Soyuz rocket.It has engines with better injection system.It also has digital<br>
flight control and telementery systems which allow the rocket to be launch from a fixed platfrom whereas the launch platforms<br>
for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight.The Soyuz-2<br>
family includes 2.1a/STA, 2.1b/STB, and 2.1v.The 2.1b version adds an upgraded engine (RD-0124) which greatly increases the<br>
specific impulse of the upper stage (326 seconds to 359 seconds), and hence improves payload capability from 7 tonnes to 8.2<br>
tonnes.It is a "light" version of the Soyuz-2 without the side boosters (blocks B, V, G and D).2.1v can veliver up to 2.8 tonnes<br>
to low Earth orbit. </p>

<hr>
<h4>One thing common among all soyuz rockets is that they an open trusswork in between stages.Why is this so?</h4>
<img src = "soyuzinterstage.jpg" height=400px width = 340px>
<img src = "soyuzinterstage2.jpg" height = 400px width = 720px>
<p>It is for 'hot staging'.Here the second stage ingnites before the stage sep.This is done to accelarate the second stage to bring the fuel down<br>
into the engine.Usually for this ullage motors are used which fire after stage separation.The disadvantage of doing hot staging is that it wastes<br>
some fuel.The open trusswork ensure there is no pressure buildup in the interstage.</p>
