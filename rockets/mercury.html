<p>The little joe rocket was a 17 metres launch vehicle used for testing the mercury capsule.Its main purpose<br>
was to test the launch abort system at max q(max q is when a rocket experiences maximum aerodynamic forces).<br></p>
<br>
<p>The mercury redstone rocket was a 25.4 metres suborbital rocket.It was used to launch a chimpanzee named Ham<br>
to space.It also launched the first american in space(Alan Shepard).</p>
