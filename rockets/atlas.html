<h3>Atlas A</h3>
<p>Atlas A was the first full scale prototype of the atlas missile.It did not have the stage and a ahalf design and used 2 fixed booster<br>
engines.<br></p>
<h3>Atlas B</h3>
<p>Atlas B was the first atlas missile to use the stage and a half design.It also had a sustainer engine.Atlas B used explosive bolts to<br>
jettison the booster section.It had 9 sub-orbital flights as an ICBM.In its eighth flight it launched the world's first communication <br>
satellite(SCORE) into orbit which was used by former US president Eisenhower to broadcast a christmas message.<br></p>
<h3>Atlas C</h3>
<p>Atlas C was similar to Atlas B, but had a larger LOX tank and smaller RP-1 tank due to technical changes to the Rocketdyne engines.<br>
Booster burn time was much longer than the A/B series, up to 151 seconds. </p>
<h3>Atlas-ABLE</h3>
<p>Atlas-Able was a three and a half stage rocket.It used the other atlas rockets as first stage and had vangaurd upper stages(Able second<br>
stage , Altair third stage).The first Atlas-Able used an Atlas C as the first stage, but this exploded during a static fire test on 24 September.<br>
1959.All 3 launches of this rocket had failed.</p>
<h3>Atlas Agena</h3>
<p>The Atlas-Agena was a two-and-a-half-stage rocket, with a stage-and-a-half Atlas missile as the first stage, and an RM-81 Agena second<br>
stage.It was used to launch the mariner probes to mars,venus and probes to moon.The agena second stage was powered by hypergolic fuel.Four<br>
variants were developed-A,B,C,D.Agena A did not have restart capability(it could not stop its engine and then restart it later) and was <br>
mostly flown on Thor-Agena rocket.Agena B was restartable and had long propellant tanks.After several failure NASA asked for an improved<br>
version to launch their probes.In the end  modified atlas D and atlas E/F flew with agena D.</p>
<h3>Atlas Centaur</h3>
<p>Atlas Centaur was a launch vehicle derived from the Atlas D.It was basically an Atlas D but with a Centaur upper stage.Centaur A,B,C,D<br>
were used.Centaur A,B,C were developmental versions and failed few times and Centaur D was the first centaur version to enter operational<br>
service.</p>

<img src = "centaur.jpg" height=450px width=361px title="Centaur upper stage diagram">
<img src = "atlascentaur.png" height=450px width=780px title="Atlas Centaur diagram">
<h3>Atlas E/F-</h3>
<p>The first stage of this rocket was built using parts taken from Atlas E and F rockets.The first stage flew with several different<br>
upper stages - Agena , Altair , Burner , MSD , OIS , OV1 , PTS , SGS , Star , Trident.The MSD upper stages were used to <br>
launch naval reconnaisance satellite.The SGS upper stage onsisted of 2 solid rocket motors.The trident was used for suborbital<br>
test of reentry vehicles.</p>
<h3>Atlas G</h3>
<p>Atlas G consisted of an improved Atlas core with modernized avionics and stretched propellant tanks. The Centaur stage also<br>
had several updated components and other technical improvements.The maiden flight failed due to a minor fatigue crack developed<br>
in the Centaur LOX tank during staging and orbital injection.

<h3>Atlas 1</h3>
<p>The atlas 1 was the last atlas rocket with vernier engines.It was similar to atlas G/H.</p>

<img src = "atlas1.jpg" id="atlas1image" title="Atlas 1 CRRES mission">
<h3>Atlas 2</h3>
<p>Atlas II provided higher performance than the earlier Atlas I by using engines with greater thrust and longer<br>
fuel tanks for both stages.LR-89 and LR-105 were replaced by the RS-56.Atlas II was the last Atlas to use a<br>
"stage-and-a-half" design.The two booster engines, RS-56-OBAs, were integrated into a single unit called the<br>
MA-5A and shared a common gas generator.The Vernier engines on the first stage of the Atlas I were replaced <br>
by a hydrazine fueled roll control system.This series used an improved Centaur II upper stage, the world's<br>
first cryogenic propellant stage.There were 3 version-Atlas 2(normal),Atlas 2A,Atlas 2AS.The atlas 2A had the<br>
RL-10A4 engine on the centaur instead of the RL10A-3-3A engine.The Atlas 2AS had 4 Castor 4A solid rocket <br>
boosters.These boosters were ignited in pairs, with one pair igniting on the ground, and the second igniting<br>
in the air shortly after the first pair separated.</p>

<h3>Atlas 3</h3>
<p>The atlas 3(also called Atlas 2AR during development) was the first atlas rcket with no "stage-and-a-half" design.It used a brand<br>
new first stage with an RD-180 soviet/russian engine.The first stage had a bigger LOX tank than previous one.There were 2 versions-
3A and 3B.<br></p>
<h3>Atlas 5</h3>
<p>Atlas 5 has a rigid tank consisting of isogrid aluminium instead of the previous steel balloon tank design.Atlas V rockets have a<br>
three number configuration code.The first number represents the fairing diameter size in meters. The second number denotes the<br>
number of solid rocket motors (SRMs), which attach to the base of the rocket. The number of SRMs for a 4 meter fairing can range<br>
from 0 – 3. However, the 5-meter fairing Atlas V can support up to 5 SRMs, due to the different aerodynamic properties of the <br>
fairing.The third number denotes the number of engines on the Centaur Upper Stage.The atlas 5 is known for its high precision<br>
orbital manuevers.</p>

<h3>One and a half staging</h3>
<p>Most modern conventional rockets use staging.Here there are 2 or more rocket stages present.Each stage has its own propellant<br>
tanks and engines.Once one of the stage runs out,it is ditched and second stage fires and so on...This way fuel is not wasted<br>
carrying empty tanks.However during early atlas development rocket scientists didnt know if they could light the engine midflight.<br>
So they lighted all the engines at once during launch.All 3 engines were connected to the same fuel tank.Then after 172 seconds into<br>
launch the booster engines were jettisoned.The sustainer engine powered the rest of the rocket all the way to orbit.</p>

<h3>Missions-</h3>
<h4>Atlas 4A-</h4>
<p>This was the first launch of an atlas vehicle.It happened on 11th june,1957.Engine start proceeded normally and the launcher<br>
release system also functioned properly. All went well until T+26 seconds when the B-2 engine lost thrust, followed two seconds<br>
later by the B-1 engine.The rocket then tumbled over and started burning.The Atlas reached a peak altitude of 9800 feet (2900<br>
meters) and at T+50 seconds the range safety officer sent the self destruct command.The failuer happened because some of the <br>
exhaust gases went through a tube and burnt some wiring.The Atlas 6A(next test) was also a failure.<br>
</p>
<img src = "tumblingatlas.png" height=450px width=600px title="Atlas 4A flight">
<p>The third flight(Atlas 12A) was the first successful flight of an atlas vehicle.</p>
<p>The pioneer P-3 , P-30 , P-31 were all lunar orbiter missions.They were launched by the Atlas Able rocket.All 3 of these ended as failures.The rocket either<br>
failed in flight or exploded on the pad.</p>
<img src = "atlasnotsoable.png" title="Atlas not-so-able burning on pad" height = 500px width = 500px>
<br>
<h4>MA-6-</h4>
<p>The MA-6 carried the an american astronaut to orbit for the first time.The Atlas-Mercury rocket carried the mercury capsule named Friendship 7 with John <br>
Glenn in it.</p>
<br>
<h4>The first Atlas-Centaur flight-</h4>
<p>The first atlas centaur flight had a lot of delays due to technical problems such as hydrogen leakage,guidance system malfunction etc.It launched on 8 May<br>
1982 but under a minute into the launch the Centaur stage ruptured and disintegrated.The failure was determined to be caused by an insulation panel that <br>
ripped off the Centaur during ascent, resulting in a surge in tank pressure when the liquid hygrogen overheated.The second flight was successful and <br>
became the first use of a hydrogen rocket engine in space.In 1966 an Atlas Centaur rocket boosted the surveyor 1 too the moon becoming NASA's first <br>
extraterrestrial landing.It was also used to launch agena target vehicles for the gemini program.</p>
<br>
<p>Atlas-agena was used to launch the mariner and ranger programs which visited moon,mercury,mars and venus and military programs like MIDAS(Missile<br> Defense Alarm System).</p>
<br>
<p>Big Joe 1 launch an uncrewed boilerplate mercury capsule into a suborbitl trajectory to test its heat shield.The launch had some problems with the engines <br>
not operating correctly and capsule not separating.However the capsule did separate after exhausting its RCS fuel.</p>
<br>
<h4>Starliner OFT-2</h4>
<img src = "atlasoft2.jpg" title="Atlas 5 launching a starliner capsule" height = 400px width = 700px>
<p>The starliner is a crewed capsule developed by boeing under a NASA contract.Boeing buys Atlas launches from ULA to launch them.OFT2 was the second <br>
uncrewed starliner test afer the first one failed to dock with the iss.Aside from some minor thruster failures during orbital manuevering,the mission was<br>
a success.</p> 
<br>
<p>Atlas 5 also launches US space force/US Department of Defense satellites.</p>
