<h1>Minotaur launch vehicles</h1>
<p>The minotaur rocket family consists of 6 american solid-fueled rockets.These rockets have been derived from the<br>
minuteman and peacemaker ICBM's.This is the reason minotaur rockets have high TWR(Thrust to Weight Ratio) which <br>
causes it to go up very fast as ICBM's need to deliver their payload quickly.<br></p>
