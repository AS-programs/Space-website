<h3>Delta 2-</h3>
<p>Delta 2 was originally built by McDonell Douglas company which was later merged with boeing in 1997.The first<br>
stage of a delta 2 had rocketdyne RS-27 engine and was called as  'Extra-Extended Long Tank Thor' sine it was a<br>
derivative of the thor ballistic missile.Delta 2 also had SRB's.For the 6000-series, Delta II used Castor 4A <br>
boosters, while the 7000-series used Graphite-Epoxy Motors manufactured by ATK.The second stage had a Aerojet <br>
AJ10 engine.There was a third stage present for beyond LEO destinations such as GTO or trans-Mars trajectory.<br>
This stage was powered by solid fuel and was spin stabilized,meaning it spinned during stage separtion to give<br>
the satellite more stability.After stage sep to reduce the spins the satellite used a yo-yo de spin mechanism.<br>
The satellite released long threads with weights at the end.To conserve angular momentum the satellite slowed<br>
down.Then the threads were ejected.<br>
The delta 2 used a 4 digit naming system-<br>
The first digit was either 6 or 7, denoting the 6000- or 7000-series Delta.<br>
The second digit indicated the number of boosters. Most Delta II rockets flew with 9 boosters, but some flew with<br>
3 or 4.<br>
The third digit was always 2, denoting a second stage with an Aerojet AJ10 engine. Only Deltas prior to the<br>
6000-series used a different engine, the TR-201.<br>
The last digit denoted the third stage. 0 denoted no third stage, 5 indicated a Payload Assist Module (PAM)<br>
stage with Star 48B solid motor, and 6 indicated a Star 37FM motor.<br>
An H following the four digits denoted that the vehicle used the larger Delta III GEM-46 boosters.</p>

<h3>Delta 3</h3>
<p>Delta 3 or the delta 8930 was the next delta rocket.Unlike delta 2,it used kerosene and oxygen.It had 2 vernier engines for controlling roll.The diameter of <br>
the kerosene tank was increased from 2.4 meters to 4 meters.This reduced the overall length of the vehicle and allowed the Delta III to use the same launch <br>
facilities as the Delta II with only minor modifications.First stage had 9 GEM 46 solid rocket boosters.Six were ignited on the launch pad, while the <br>
remaining three were ignited just before burnout and separation of the ground-lit boosters. To maintain steering authority, three of the boosters had<br>
vectoring nozzles.The delta 3 had a DCSS(Delta Cryogenic Upper Stage) which burnt liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.The RL-10B-2 was similar to <br>
RL-10 but had electromechanical actuators for gimbal control and extended nozzle for highrt specific impulse.Extended nozzle increases specific impulse<br>
as less thrust is wasted in gas expanding outwards.The rocket had only 3 launches.2 failed and one was a partial failure reaching lower than planned <br>
orbit.</p>
