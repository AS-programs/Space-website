<h1>Project Gemini</h1>
<img src = "geminipatch.jpg" id = "geminilogo" height = 200px width  200px>
<p>The gemini program was a human spaceflight program by nasa which lasted from 1961 to 1966.It carried 16 astronauts<br>
to LEO.</p>
<br>

<p id = "titanrocket">Titan 2 is an ICBM developed by Glenn L. Martin Company.It was later turned<br>
into a medium lift rocket.It launched payloads for NASA,NOAA,USAF.<br>

<h2>Gemini capsule</h2>
<img src = "geminicapsule1.jpg" height = 350px width = 470px>
<img src = "geminicapsule2.jpg" height = 350px width = 550px>
<p>The gemini capsule was an upgraded,bigger version of the mercury capsule.Howerver unlike the mercury capsule it had its oxygen,water and propulsion<br>
in the adapter module(the white part) which detached before reentry.Also unlike mercury the gemini capsule's launch abort system did not use solid <br>
rocket motors.Instead they had ejection seats.This was a pretty bad idea as the ejection seats firing could have killed the crew as the cabin was filled<br>
with pure oxygen whereas when nasa tested the capsule abort it was filled with nitrogen.(this lesson was learnt the hard way in apollo 1 mission).<br><br>
The adaptor module had 2 modules-equipment module ,retro module.<br>
The equipment module contained the OAMS(Orbital Altitude and Manuevering System) which had sixteen thrusters for pitch,<br>
yaw,roll and translation control.<br>
The retro module contained four solid-fuel TE-M-385 Star-13E retrorockets which were used to deorbit the capsule.<br><br>
Initially nasa had planned to land the capsule using a rogallo wing but it turned out to be too unreliable and hard to control so they switched it out<br>
for the good old parachute touchdown at sea.

<h3>Agena target vehicle-</h3>
<img src = "agenatargetvehicle.jpg" id = "agenaimage">
<p>The agena vehicle was an uncrewed spacecraft made to test orbital revendouz and docking<br>
for NASA's gemini program.NASA needed to practice docking in space for its upcoming apollo <br>
missions.The agena spacecraft was used in 7 missions out of which 2 were successful.In the <br>
Gemini 10 mission the agena vehicle used its thrusters to boost the gemini spacecraft <br>
to an orbit with an apogee of 763km and later another agena vehicle boosted gemini 11 <br>
to an apogee of 1369km.</p>
<br>
<h2>Missions-</h2>
<p>
<ul class = geminimissions>
<li><b>Gemini 4</b> had the first american EVA which was performed by Ed White on June 3rd,1965.</li>
<li><b>Gemini 6A</b> along with gemini 7 performed the first space revendouz.This required some<br> very precise orbital manuevers.</li>
<li><b>Gemini 8</b> under the command of Neil Armstrong achieved the first space docking.It docked<br> 
with an Agena vehicle.However soon after docking it started rotating fastly.Armstrong thought it <br>
was a thruster malfunction on the Agena vehicle and undocked the gemini.However then it began<br>
to rotate faster as it no longer help the mass of the agena vehicle.This forced armstrong the engage<br>
the reentry thrusters.This mission was the first american emergency landing. Luckily none of the <br>
astronauts were hurt.</li>
<li><b>Gemini 11</b> was the highest earth orbit mission.It went upto 1,369.0 km which was the highest<br>
of any non-apollo manned spacecraft</li>
