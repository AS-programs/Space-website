<h3>Falcon 1</h3>
<p>Falcon 1 was an expendable launch vehicle privately developed and manufactured by spacex.It had its first flight <br>
on 24th march 2006 which failed due to an engine failure.These were followed by another failures caused by harmonic <br>
oscillations,premature engine shutdown and its third failure was caused by residual stage 1 thrust leading to collision<br>
of first and second stages immediately after stage separation.Its first successful flight was on 3 August 2008 and carried<br>
a mass simulator.Its final flight was the only commercial flight of the falcon 1 which carrid the malaysian RazakSAT to LEO.<br></p>
<br>
<h3>Falcon 9</h3>
<p>The falcon 9 is a partially reusable launch vehicle manufactured and operated by spacex.It is the most flown rocket in this<br>
decade with upto 50 launches per year.After stage separation the first stage soon performs a reentry burn and then uses its<br>
grid fins to manuever around.Then it performs a "suicide burn".Falcon 9 is not cabale of hovering(having a TWR of 1) so it has<br>
to perform a "last minute" burn to quickly cancel out its downwards velocity.Then it deploys its landing legs and performs a <br>
landing on a ground pad or a droneship(A Shortfall Of Gravitas(ASOG) or Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY) or Just Read the<br>
Instructions (JRTI).The second stage continues on its path to orbit the after payload deploymeny it deorbits itself.<br><br>
The falcon 9 has launched many mission including several starlink missions,1 interplanetary mission(DART probe),several<br>
commercial mission,several iss cargo resupply mission(CRS)(using the dragon capsule) and 4 crewed missions(Crew 1,Crew 2<br>
,Crew 3,Inspiration 4).Till now it has had 2 failed missions(CRS 7,AMOS 6).</p>
